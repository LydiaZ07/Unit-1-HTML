        Hello(:, I am a current sophomore at Staten Island Technical High School. My favorite thing
        to do and look forward to after a long week of school is playing badminton on the weekends. I am the middle
        child of my family which I personally would say is not the greatest place to be in. I am looking forward to
        learning how to code!
